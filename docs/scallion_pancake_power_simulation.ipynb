    "It aids in figuring out the efficiency of a circuit or device and is especially helpful for battery-operated devices or energy-sensitive applications. By understanding how much power a circuit consumes, we can select appropriate components such as power supplies, batteries, and voltage regulators, ensuring they can handle the load and operate reliably. This knowledge also helps in budgeting and planning for energy usage, which is essential for projects with power constraints or limited power sources. Furthermore, accurate calculations prevent overloading components, which can lead to overheating, failure, or safety hazards. In addition to all of this, compliance with power consumption or efficiency standards may be necessary for certain applications—in our case, there are various contraints we have on our PCB for Spaceport Amarica—making it imperative to calculate power and current draw to ensure adherence to these standards."
