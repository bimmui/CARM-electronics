# Working Sensor Package
# Rocket Engine Temperature Sensor (Resistive Thermocoupe)
# Temperature Sensor Board to measure External Ambient Temperature
# GPS Module to determine Telemetry
# Inertial Measurement Unit to determine Telemetry
# Altimeter to determine Height


# Ideal layout
# Upper Right should be the GPS positioning, both raw, but if we could underlay a map that would be great
# Upper Left should be the IMU, with the 3 axis, and the 3 axis of rotation

# Upper RIght next to GPS should be a small image of Rocket with the current altitude, and speed
# Upper Left next to IMU should be a small image of the rocket with the current ambient temperature, and engine temperature

# Lower Row should be Graphs, with the left being the altitude, and the right being the speed, and center being Temperature
